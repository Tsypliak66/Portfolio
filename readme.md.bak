## About me

I'm a QA Engineer who has 9 monthes experience in manual QA engineer for web applications and 6 monthes in UI/API authomated testing. 

I started my IT journey with Manual Testing, working on web apps in blogging, education, and marketing. I used Jira & Qase for managing test documentation.

I also have some experience in Automation testing, where I worked on tests for an e-commerce platform. I used tools such as CucumberJS, WebDriver IO, and Axios.

Additionally, I'm good at keeping things organized, familiar with the Agile way of working using SCRUM and Kanban, and I understand concepts of REST API, OOP, JSON, XML, HTML, and CSS.

I enjoy learning, and my focus is on improving in testing and quality assurance. I'm looking for opportunities to develop and contribute my skills.

- For example, like on lines 7 and 15 from the script in the previous screenshot

![when](images/When.png)

- The clickElementByName(elementName) function, in turn, is implemented like this

![clickElementByName](images/clickElementByName.png)

- the click function is from the WebDriverIO framework, and the getSingleElementBySelectorName(selectorName) function is implemented like this

![getSingleElementBySelectorName](images/GetSingleElementBySelectorName.png)

- functions getPageElementSelectorByName(selectorName) and getSingleElementByPath(selector) are implemented as follows

![getPageElementSelectorByName](images/getPageElementSelectorByName.png)

- a web element in each class is defined (for example in LoginPage):
